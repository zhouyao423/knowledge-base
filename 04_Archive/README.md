# 🗄️ Archive

Inactive items preserved for future reference.

## Purpose

The Archive stores:

- Completed projects with their outputs
- Inactive areas no longer maintained
- Old notes for historical reference
- Deprecated resources
- Past experiments and iterations

## What Goes Here

### From Projects

- Completed projects with final deliverables
- Cancelled projects with lessons learned
- Projects inactive for 30+ days

### From Areas

- Areas no longer relevant to your life
- Responsibilities you've handed off
- Roles you no longer have

### From Resources

- Outdated information (but historically interesting)
- Superseded frameworks or methods
- Old versions of evolved ideas

### From Inbox

- Processed items no longer needed
- Old daily notes (after extraction)
- Random captures without lasting value

## Organization

## Archival Process

### Before Archiving Projects

1. Create completion summary
2. Extract reusable insights to Resources
3. Document lessons learned
4. Update any related Areas
5. Move entire folder with structure intact

### Sample Completion Summary

```markdown
# Project: [Name] - Completion Summary

**Duration**: Start date - End date **Status**: Completed/Cancelled/Suspended

## Objectives

- Original goal 1 ✓
- Original goal 2 ✓
- Original goal 3 ✗

## Key Outcomes

- What was delivered
- What impact it had
- What value was created

## Lessons Learned

- What worked well
- What didn't work
- What to do differently

## Reusable Assets

- Templates created: [[link]]
- Processes developed: [[link]]
- Insights gained: [[link]]

## Related Notes

- Continues in: [[Area name]]
- See also: [[Related project]]
```

## Claude Code Workflows

### Archive Project

```
Help me archive [project name].
Create a completion summary.
Extract reusable insights to Resources.
Move everything to Archive.
```

### Search Archive

```
Search the archive for anything about [topic].
I need historical context.
```

### Year in Review

```
Review all archived projects from [year].
What patterns do you see?
What did I accomplish?
```

### Resurrect Project

```
I want to revive [archived project].
What was the status when archived?
What would need updating?
```

## Archive Philosophy

### It's Not a Graveyard

- Archives preserve institutional memory
- Old projects inform new ones
- Patterns emerge over time
- Ideas can be resurrected

### It's Not a Dumping Ground

- Archive thoughtfully
- Maintain some organization
- Keep summaries accessible
- Delete true junk

## Claude Code Prompts

### Historical Analysis

```
Look at my archived projects.
What types of things do I tend to start but not finish?
What themes recur?
```

### Knowledge Mining

```
Search the archive for any mentions of [concept].
How has my thinking evolved?
```

### Pattern Recognition

```
Analyze my project completion rate.
What factors correlate with success?
What patterns predict failure?
```

## Maintenance

### Quarterly

- Review recent additions
- Ensure summaries exist
- Check for resurrection candidates

### Annually

- Major archive cleanup
- Delete what's truly dead
- Extract any missed insights
- Reorganize if needed

## Tips

- **Date everything** - Future you will thank you
- **Summarize always** - Context fades quickly
- **Link liberally** - Connections survive archival
- **Search often** - Archives are meant to be used
- **Delete fearlessly** - Not everything needs keeping

## Remember

The Archive is your institutional memory. It's not about holding onto
everything, but about preserving what might inform future work. Use Claude Code
to help you see patterns across time and extract wisdom from experience.
